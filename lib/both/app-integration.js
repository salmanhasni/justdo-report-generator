// This file is the last file we load for this package and it's loaded in both
// server and client (keep in mind! don't put non-secure code that shouldn't be
// exposed to clients here).
//
// Uncomment to create an instance automatically on server/client init
//
// If you uncomment this, uncomment in package.js the load of meteorspark:app
// package.
//
// Avoid this step in packages that implements pure logic that isn't specific
// to the JustDo app. Pure logic packages should get all the context they need
// to work with collections/other plugins instances/etc. as options.

// **Method A:** If you aren't depending on any env variable just comment the following

// APP.report_generator = new ReportGenerator()

// **Method B:** If you are depending on env variables to decide whether or not to load
// this package, or even if you use them inside the constructor, you need to wait for
// them to be ready, and it is better done here.

APP.getEnv(function(env) {
  // If an env variable affect this package load, check its value here
  // remember env vars are Strings

  const options = {
    projects_collection: APP.collections.Projects,
    tasks_collection: APP.collections.Tasks
  };

  APP.report_generator = new ReportGenerator(options);
